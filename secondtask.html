    For a complex-shaped polymer part, conventional molding process is used. This is because we only need less than 10 units and lead time is less than 3 days, so the conventional molding would be a best possible option. We cannot use the injection molding for this material, because for this number of quantities the lead time will be more as compared to conventional molding and the batch size will also be large.
